  <h2>My Story</h2>

</div>

<div class="page-content">
  <p>Beginning very early, like many others in the computer industry, I learned to write batch files, QBASIC code, repair computers, set up small networks and be interested in learning all aspects of computers. I ran a bulletin board system (BBS) and was a hub for FidoNet before the internet was popular. Shortly after, I began working for a local computer shop doing on-site repairs, custom builds, and sales; all around the age of sixteen. I began developing websites and was challenged to work in PERL to begin writing basic CGI scripts in my early stages of ecommerce.</p>

  <p>I began dabbling in graphic design and digital photography, mostly for the purpose of websites, though to be fair, I've never really considered myself overly artistic. I left for college and while attending, worked primarily as a freelance webdesigner (and bartender – I liked to have fun in college, and still do).</p>

  <p>I graduated from the University of Florida and am a rabid Florida Gator fan. I received a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration and a minor in Classical Studies; I went into college having a strong grasp and background in computers and looked to diversify my knowledge, specifically in business.</p>

  <p>After college, I came out and quickly began working as a full time web developer. I worked primarily in PHP and MySQL. It wasn’t very long before I was doing all aspects of business that a small web design firm deals with; such as initial sales, contact relationships, graphic design, project management, programming, database architecture, and ongoing client support and upgrades. I decided that since I was able to handle working in so many various areas it would be a good idea to simply start my own company. So I did; which lasted about three months until I bought my first home and realized that I didn’t have the financial reserve to withstand late payments from clients, the inertia of starting a company, or the amazing amount of time and energy that was required.</p>

  <p>A great thing happened, I went searching for other web design firms that I could offer my programming services to and came across a hidden gem of a company in my home town that specializes in large scale ecommerce for global companies. The initial and ongoing relationship I’ve built with this company (as a full time employee for three years) has been absolutely exceptional. It has provided me the ability to grow, learn, and help teach others along the way.</p>

  <p>After OMS, I began working for an insurance company, where I was happy to bring a bit of experience as well as continue to be exposed to new technology and unique requirements and challenges. I was able to learn quite a bit about working for a larger company and many of the regulatory requirements necessary in the insurance industry.</p>

  <p>From insurance, I switched into a medical research and manufacturing company in Naples and was very excited to address the challenges and concerns with working with several technological platforms including a full-fledged ERP system as well as the dynamic business processes employed. It was at Arthrex where I really had the opportunity to understand corporate life for a billion+ company as well as the unique constraints of working in an FDA regulated environment.</p>

  <p>I now work as the Chief Technology Officer in the aviation industry for a multi-tenant SaaS software company which handles aviation maintenance tracking and a variety of other flight-related services. We have an extremely talented and senior-laden team of software developers in a variety of technologies and are embarking on a complete reinvention of the software product line and operational processes.</p>

  <p>I believe it’s important to push yourself and never become complacent; at each new crossroad I learn and develop exponentially greater.</p>

  <p>I would like to begin collecting the information that I’ve learned (and continue to learn) and provide that information here in a very straightforward way to any of those who are interested. Ideally, I hope that this small online presence will encourage others to participate in code discussion, sampling, and learning together.</p>

  <p>If you’ve made it to the end of this, then I thank you for your interest and support, and wish you a wealth of knowledge and success.</p>
