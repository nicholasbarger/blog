<h2>My Career</h2>

<p>Beginning very early, like many others in the computer industry, I learned to write batch files, QBASIC code, repair computers, set up small networks and became interested in learning all aspects of computers. I ran a bulletin board system (BBS) and was a hub for FidoNet before the internet was mainstream. Shortly after, I began working for a local computer shop doing on-site repairs, custom builds, and sales; all around the age of sixteen. I began developing websites and started working in PERL to write basic CGI scripts in my early stages of eCommerce.</p>

<p>I began dabbling in graphic design and digital photography, mostly for the purpose of websites, though to be fair, I've never really considered myself overly artistic. I left for college and while attending, worked primarily as a freelance webdesigner (and bartender – it was college after all).</p>

<p>I graduated from the University of Florida and have been an avid Florida Gator fan ever since. I received a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration and a minor in Classical Studies; I went into college having a strong grasp and background in computers and looked to diversify my knowledge, specifically in business.</p>

<p>After college, I quickly began working as a full time web developer. I worked primarily in PHP and MySQL and it wasn’t very long before I was doing all aspects of business that a small web design firm deals with; such as initial sales, contact relationships, graphic design, project management, programming, database architecture, and ongoing client support and upgrades. I decided that since I was able to handle working in so many various areas it would be a good idea to simply start my own company. So I did; which lasted about three months until I bought my first home and realized that I didn’t have the financial reserve to withstand late payments from clients, the inertia of starting a company, or the amazing amount of time and energy that was required.</p>

<p>A great thing happened, I went searching for other web design firms that I could offer my programming services to and came across a hidden gem of a company in my home town that specialized in large scale eCommerce for global companies. The initial and ongoing relationship I built with this company (as a full time employee for three years) was absolutely exceptional. It has provided me the ability to grow, learn, and help teach others along the way and I will forever be in debt to certain individuals at this company.</p>

<p>After OMS, I began working for an insurance company, where I was happy to bring a bit of experience as well as continue to be exposed to new technology and unique requirements and challenges. I was able to learn quite a bit about working for a larger company and many of the regulatory requirements necessary in the insurance industry.  I also steadily learned more about architecture and vendor management during my time at Florida Family Insurance.</p>

<p>From insurance, I switched into a medical device design and manufacturing company in Naples and was very excited to address the challenges and concerns with working with several technological platforms including a my first true ERP (little did I know, we would have QAD, Oracle, and SAP during my career at Arthrex) system as well as the dynamic business processes employed. It was at Arthrex where I really had the opportunity to understand corporate life for a billion+ company as well as the unique constraints of working in an FDA regulated environment. It was quite a time for Arthrex, as the company expanded at a record pace.  I will forever be inspired by the drive and presence that Reinhold Schmieding brought to a room and an entire company.</p>

<p>I now work as the Chief Technology Officer for Flightdocs in the aviation industry for a multi-tenant SaaS software company which handles aviation maintenance tracking and a variety of other flight-related services. We have an extremely talented and senior-laden team of software developers in a variety of technologies and are embarking on a complete reinvention of the software product line and operational processes. Here I am able to exercise my passion for product development with a focus on strategy while still maintaining my love of architecture and software development.</p>

<p>I believe it’s important to push yourself and never become complacent; at each new crossroad I learn and develop exponentially greater.</p>

<p>I would like to begin collecting the information that I’ve learned (and continue to learn) and provide that information here in a very straightforward way to any of those who are interested. Ideally, I hope that this small online presence will encourage others to participate in software development, technology and learning together.</p>

<p>If you’ve made it to the end of this, then I thank you for your interest and support, and wish you a wealth of knowledge and success.</p>

<h3>P.S. - I Have a Home Life Too</h3>

<p>Not well represented on my website is the fact that I have a wonderful family with a wife and two amazing daughters that I am incredibly proud of.</p>

<p>I enjoy working on houses, fishing, gardening, and watching the Florida Gators.</p>
