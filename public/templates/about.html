<h2>My Story</h2>

<p>Beginning very early like many others in the computer industry, I learned to write batch files, QBASIC code, repair computers, set up small networks and be interested in learning all aspects of computers. I ran a bulletin board system (BBS) and was a hub for FidoNet before the internet really took off. Shortly after, I began working for a local computer shop doing onsite repairs, custom builds, and sales; all around the age of sixteen. I began developing websites and was challenged to work in PERL to begin writing very basic CGI scripts in my early stages of ecommerce.</p>

<p>I began dabbling in graphic design and digital photography, mostly for the purpose of websites. I left for college and while attending, worked primarily as a freelance webdesigner (and bartender – I liked to have fun in college, and still do).</p>

<p>I graduated from the University of Florida and am a rabid Florida Gator fan. I received a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration. It is important to stress that I did not receive a degree in computer science, computer engineering, or any of the explicit science/engineering disciplines. I went into college having a strong grasp and background in computers and looked to diversify my knowledge, specifically in business.</p>

<p>After college, I came out and quickly began working as a fulltime web developer. I worked primarily in PHP and MySQL. It wasn’t very long before I was doing all aspects of business that a small web design firm deals with; such as initial sales, contact relationships, graphic design, project management, programming, database architecture, and ongoing client support and upgrades. I decided that since I was able to handle working in so many various areas it would be a good idea to simply start my own company. So I did; which lasted about three months until I bought my first home and realized that I didn’t have the financial reserve to withstand late payments from clients, the inertia of starting a company, or the amazing amount of time and energy that was required.</p>

<p>A great thing happened, I went searching for other web design firms that I could offer my programming services to and came across a hidden gem of a company in my home town that specializes in large scale ecommerce for global companies. The initial and ongoing relationship I’ve built with this company (as a full time employee for three years) has been absolutely exceptional. It has provided me the ability to grow, learn, and help teach others along the way.</p>

<p>After OMS, I began working for an insurance company, where I was happy to bring a bit of experience as well as continue to be exposed to new technology and unique requirements and challenges. I was able to learn quite a bit about working for a larger company and many of the regulatory requirements necessary in the insurance industry.</p>

<p>Most recently, I’ve begun working for a medical research and manufacturing company in Naples and am very excited to address the challenges and concerns with working with several technological platforms including a full-fledged ERP system as well as the dynamic business processes employed.</p>

<p>I believe it’s important to push yourself and never become complacent; at each new crossroad I learn and develop exponentially greater.</p>

<p>I would like to begin collecting the information that I’ve learned (and continue to learn) and provide that information here in a very straightforward way to any of those who are interested. Ideally, I hope that this small online presence will encourage others to participate in code discussion, sampling, and learning together.</p>

<p>If you’ve made it to the end of this, then I thank you for your interest and support, and wish you a wealth of knowledge and success.</p>
