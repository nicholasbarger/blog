Not a problem with Tredosoft's MultipleIE.  First, install IE7 to use the most current version as your primary and then download TredoSoft's MultipleIE and run shelled versions of IE 3.0-6.0. on the same machine.The solution isn't necessarily 100%, but it does provide a quick, simply, and <strong>free</strong> approach to multi-browser testing.Of course, you may also want to install some additional browers for testing purposes; I've added a pretty common lineup for reference:<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/ie/getitnow.mspx\" target=\"_blank\">IE 7</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie6/downloads/default.mspx\" target=\"_blank\">IE 6</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.google.com/chrome\" target=\"_blank\">Google Chrome</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/safari/\">Safari</a></li></ul>You can download the latest version of TredoSoft's MultipleIE here:<a href=\"http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE\" target=\"_blank\">http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE</a><em><strong>Note:  Unfortunately, Multiple IE will not work in Windows Vista, a known issue.</strong></em><h2>Browser Cam</h2>There is also a service (probably several) which provides you a much richer collection of browser/OS permutations for testing called <a href=\"http://www.browsercam.com\" target=\"_blank\">Browser Cam</a>.This service does cost money (day, month, year subscriptions), but allows you to terminal into OS-specific client machines and test different browsers easily.<em>Note: I've experienced a bit of a delay when using Browser Cam, and occasionally boxes do temporarily go down (or at least appear unavailable) from time to time, so make sure you allocate a bit of testing time aside for using services such as Browser Cam.</em>"}
