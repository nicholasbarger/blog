So what is the purpose of adding yet another?  Well, personally there are several reasons.  I have learned from the effort of others, either by personal interaction or simply by the provision of their collective knowledge.  Perhaps I can give back a little bit of my own knowledge in such a way that makes sense to at least some of the visitors that should happen to read these posts.  Also, it is my desire that visitors to this website feel comfortable in discussing the articles, blogs posts, and other information provided and become active in contributing to the samples provided and make our knowledge base more complete.Please feel free to contribute and help us all learn together."}
