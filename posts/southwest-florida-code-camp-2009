Code Camp will be held at <a href=\"http://www.fgcu.edu\" target=\"_blank\">Florida Gulf Coast University</a> in Fort Myers, FL and is sure to turn out a substantial crowd of developers as well as a great collection of distinguished speakers.If you're interested in attending the Southwest Florida Code Camp, head over to <a href=\"http://codecamp.swfldev.net\" target=\"_blank\"> to find out more and sign up for free.</a>Code Camp should cover several different topics in various tracks including the following:<ul><li>.NET 4.0 Entity Framework</li><li>Be Productive with MVC: Telerik Open Source Extensions for ASP.NET MVC</li><li>Bing Map Web Control API</li><li>Building Windows Mobile Widgets</li><li>Cloud Computing: What you can do now to move your software infrastructure online</li><li>Code Style &amp; Standards</li><li>Enterprise Library and Unity Tips &amp; Techniques</li><li>Game Programming on Windows Mobile</li><li>Introduction to DotNetNuke 5</li><li>Introduction to DotNetNuke 5 Widgets</li></ul><h2>Preparing for Code Camp</h2>Before attending an educational seminar such as Code Camp, I prefer to do a bit of research on the topics presented.  Most lectures provide a good introduction to the topic, so it's not critical to \"study-up\", but I've found that you get the most \"bank for your buck\" when you come in knowing a little already.Additionally, a great way to understand and retain the information from Code Camp is to come with a specific project in mind and ask yourself \"How can <em>this</em> subject make my project better?\".  At least in my case, I tend to retain much more by applying the topic to a real life application.<h3>A Few Links to Help You Prep</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.bing.com/developers\" target=\"_blank\">bing Develop Center</a> - <a href=\"http://www.nicholasbarger.com/26-Virtual_Earth_and_the_Windows_Live_CTP\">Read Virtual Earth and the Windows Live CTP</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.telerik.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Telerik (third party control suites) - </a><a href=\"http://www.nicholasbarger.com/42-Battle_of_the_Third_Party_Controls\">Read Battle of the Third Party Controls</a></li><li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsmobile/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Mobile Developer Center</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/azure/windowsazure.mspx\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Azure Platform</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.nicholasbarger.com/29-Homegrown_CSS_Standards\">Read Homegrown CSS Standards</a></li><li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc467894.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Enterprise Library</a> - (See <a href=\"http://www.davidhayden.com/\" target=\"_blank\">David Hayden</a>)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.dotnetnuke.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DotNetNuke</a></li></ul><h2>Job Hunting</h2>For those of you developers that have been hit hard by the current economic market, Code Camp acts as a double wammy to keep you sharp and build on your current skillset as well as being a forum to meet recruiters, fellow developers, and potentially, your next job opening.
