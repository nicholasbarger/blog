There was a solid turn out, mostly because they were forced for an assignment, but we’ll take credit anyway.</p><p>I mentioned during the session that writing a blog was an extremely beneficial endeavor and in doing so remembered how I’ve neglected to write anything within the past month.  Oops.</p><p>So, to both fill a little content, and provide the material for any of the students that were interested please enjoy this short post of the slide deck from our presentation.</p><a href=\"http://nbarger.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/careers-in-technology.pptx\" target=\"_blank\">Careers in Technology Presentation</a><h2>Presenting at Oracle Open World (Value of Upgrading to Release 12.1 of Oracle Manufacturing)</h2><img src=\"http://nbarger.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/oracle-openworld-stage.png\" alt=\"Oracle OpenWorld 2011\" style=\"float:right;border:none;padding:10px;\" /><p>On Oct. 6th, I presented on a customer panel regarding our new implementation of Oracle EBS, Agile PLM, and Oracle MOC.  Though the title of the talk was a little misleading for my particular part (being a fresh implementation, not an upgrade), there was a lot of good information covered that is only found in R12; specifically, the reasons for our project - Manufacturing Execution System (MES) and Manufacturing Operation Center (MOC).  There were two other customer speakers which did a great job to round out the session.  I’ve included the slide deck (with the other presenters information excluded since I did not request their permission for publishing) in the link below.</p><p>On a sidenote, Open World was a lot of fun and educational though quite sad just prior to the concert when many of us found out Steve Jobs had passed away.</p><a href=\"http://nbarger.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/arthrex-oracle-solution.pptx\" target=\"_blank\">Value of Upgrading to Release 12.1 of Oracle Manufacturing Presentation</a>"}
